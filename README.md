# IMDb Top 1000 Films Analysis

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-complete-green)

This project analyzes the IMDb Top 1000 films dataset to uncover patterns in audience ratings, critical reviews, and box office performance. The analysis explores how factors like genre and director influence a film's reception, identifies trends over time, and examines the relationship between artistic quality and commercial success.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This analysis seeks to answer several key questions about what makes a film successful, both critically and commercially.

*   **Dataset:** A cleaned dataset of the IMDb Top 1000 films, including title, director, year, genre, IMDb rating, Metascore, and box office gross.
*   **Data Source:** The original dataset and initial exploration can be found on Kaggle: [IMDb Top 1000 Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shirahazel/imdb-top-1000-movies).

### ❓ Key Questions
- How do genre and director influence a film’s critical and audience reception?
- What are the trends in film ratings, critical scores, and box office gross over the decades?
- What is the relationship between critical/audience reception and box office performance?
- Are there notable exceptions and outliers to these trends?

## 💡 Summary of Findings

-   ✨ **Genre & Director Influence:** Certain genres (e.g., Western, Mystery, Film-Noir) and renowned directors (e.g., Coppola, Nolan, Jackson) are consistently associated with higher audience ratings and critical scores.

-   📈 **Trends Over Time:** While box office gross has steadily increased over the decades (largely due to inflation and market growth), audience and critical ratings have remained remarkably stable.

-   🤔 **Ratings vs. Revenue:** There is only a weak correlation between high audience/critical scores and box office revenue. Many commercially successful films received lukewarm reviews, while some of the most critically acclaimed films were not high earners.

-   🎬 **Notable Outliers:** Several films defy the general trends. These outliers, including low-rated blockbusters and low-grossing masterpieces, were identified and are summarized in the analysis notebook.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Python 3.x**
-   **Jupyter Notebook**
-   **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
