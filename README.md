\# IMDb Top 1000 Films Analysis



This project analyzes the IMDb Top 1000 films dataset, focusing on patterns in audience ratings, critical reviews, and box office performance. The analysis explores how genre and director influence film reception, trends over time, and the relationship between quality and commercial success.



\## Project Overview



\- \*\*Dataset:\*\* IMDb Top 1000 films, including title, director, year, genre, IMDb rating, Metascore, and box office gross.

\- \*\*Key Questions:\*\*

&nbsp; - How do genre and director influence a film’s critical and audience reception?

&nbsp; - What are the trends in film ratings, critical scores, and box office gross over the decades?

&nbsp; - What is the relationship between critical/audience reception and box office performance?

&nbsp; - Are there notable exceptions to these trends?

\## Summary of Findings



\- \*\*Genre \& Director Influence:\*\* Certain genres (e.g., Western, Mystery, Film-Noir) and directors (e.g., Coppola, Nolan, Jackson) are associated with higher ratings and critical scores.

\- \*\*Trends Over Time:\*\* Box office gross has increased over the decades, while audience and critical ratings have remained relatively stable.

\- \*\*Ratings vs. Gross:\*\* There is only a weak correlation between audience/critical scores and box office revenue. Some successful films received low ratings, while some highly-rated films earned little revenue.

\- \*\*Exceptions:\*\* Notable outliers were identified and summarized in dedicated tables.
